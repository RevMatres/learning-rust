     *     - restructure API? -> GameState into a struct with a flag-field for game_over
     *  - implement this code in the actual tetris thingy
     *  - document the code: both in API docs and a detailed explanation with in-line comments,
     *    where necessery
     *  - your receivers need to make sure, that their stacks are always at 0 length, or the
     *    threads will go out of sync
     *  - backup files from playground, commit, reset playground to empty main.rs
